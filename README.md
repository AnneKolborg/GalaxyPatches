## This is the [ramses](https://bitbucket.org/dmartizzi/ramses) bitbucket repository.

Ramses is an open source code to model astrophysical systems, featuring self-gravitating, magnetised, compressible,
radiative fluid flows. It is based  on the Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)  technique on a  fully-threaded graded octree. 
[ramses](https://bitbucket.org/rteyssie/ramses) is written in Fortran 90 and makes intensive use of the 
Message Passing Interface (MPI) library. 

The main developer of the original version of the code is Romain Teyssier (University of ZÃ¼rich, romain.teyssier@gmail.com).

The version of [ramses] in this repository (https://bitbucket.org/dmartizzi/ramses) is a fork developed and maintained 
by Davide Martizzi (davide.martizzi@gmail.com) to implement new galactic feedback models.

You can go to the user's guide in [PDF here][4] and in the [WIKI here][1].
